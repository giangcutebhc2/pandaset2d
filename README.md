Create deep learning model for segmentation task on pandaset2d dataset

!!! This code is a Kaggle notebook. The dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thethien2208/pandaset-2d-images 

Please note that pandaset2d dataset is created from Pandaset, available at: https://pandaset.org/

I created a semantic segmentation model for archiving better mIoU, using DiceLoss.

# Here is the model:
